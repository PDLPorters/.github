PDL ("Perl Data Language") gives standard Perl the ability to compactly store
and speedily manipulate large N-dimensional data arrays (ndarrays). PDL
provides a DSL called PP for easily calling C code with automatic loops that
can broadcast along any dimension.

There are PDL bindings to numerical libraries such as
[BLAS/LINPACK](https://github.com/PDLPorters/pdl-linearalgebra),
[FFTW3](https://github.com/PDLPorters/pdl-fftw3),
and
[GSL](https://github.com/PDLPorters/pdl).
and plotting tools such as
[PGPLOT](https://github.com/PDLPorters/pdl/tree/master/Graphics/PGPLOT),
[PLplot](https://github.com/PDLPorters/pdl-graphics-plplot),
and
[Gnuplot](https://github.com/PDLPorters/PDL-Graphics-Gnuplot)
as well as a [simple interface](https://github.com/PDLPorters/PDL-Graphics-Simple) to many different
plotting backends.
